Are your palms sweaty?,Are you sweating?,Do you feel lightheaded?,Are your hands wet?,Do you feel restless?,Do you have headaches often?
Is your heart racing right now?,Are you afraid you'll lose control?,Does your finger feel tingly?,Are your feet wet?,Does your brain feel foggy?,Are you easily irritated?
Are you feeling uneasy?,Is your heart beating really fast?,Are you breathing normal?,Are you feel hot?,Are you able to perform your daily tasks?,Do you wake up before you want to?
Is there a fluttery feeling in your stomach?,Are you shaking?,Does your chest feel tight?,Are there areas on your body that feel clammy?,Are you able to think clearly?,Does it take a long time for you to fall asleep?
Is your mouth dry at the moment?,Are you having difficulty breathing?,Are you having trouble staying balanced?,,Can you remember things easily?,Do you wake up at random hours during the night?
Do you feel slightly dizzy?,Have you experienced chills?,,,,Are you able to focus during the day?
Are you doubting yourslf?,,,,,
